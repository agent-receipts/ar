/**
 * ReceiptChain — serialised, stateful receipt construction (ADR-0020, #488).
 *
 * Client-side chaining requires that receipt N is fully signed and its hash
 * computed before receipt N+1 is constructed. A sequential agent satisfies
 * this automatically, but an agent that fires parallel tool calls would race
 * on the shared chain head (`sequence` + `previous_receipt_hash`), producing
 * colliding sequence numbers or a forked hash link.
 *
 * `ReceiptChain` owns that mutable head. It builds → signs → hashes → links →
 * delivers each receipt through a single internal queue, so concurrent
 * {@link ReceiptChain.emit} calls are sequenced at the receipt layer even when
 * the tool calls that triggered them ran in parallel. Concurrent calls are not
 * an error — they are queued in arrival order — but the first time overlap is
 * detected a warning is emitted (see {@link ReceiptChainOptions.onConcurrentEmit}),
 * since concurrent emission usually means the caller assumed parallel chains
 * are supported. They are not in v1; a future ADR may add forked sub-chains.
 *
 * The head advances (sequence + previous hash) as soon as a receipt is signed
 * and hashed — *before* delivery — so a delivery failure leaves the chain
 * intact and linkable. Pair with a WAL-backed emitter for at-least-once
 * delivery (see ADR-0020 § "At-least-once delivery and the WAL").

# Changelog

All notable changes to the Agent Receipt Protocol specification will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** W3C VC type renamed from `AIActionReceipt` to `AgentReceipt`
- **BREAKING:** Schema file renamed from `action-receipt.schema.json` to `agent-receipt.schema.json`
- **BREAKING:** Spec document renamed from `action-receipt-spec-v0.1.md` to `agent-receipt-spec-v0.1.md`
- All example receipts updated to use `AgentReceipt` credential type
- `parameters_disclosure` widened from `{ map[string]string }` (legacy flat-map) to `{ oneOf: [legacy flat-map, HPKE asymmetric encryption envelope] }`. The envelope shape is defined by the sibling `parameters-disclosure.schema.json` introduced alongside ADR-0012 Phase A; SDK implementations: Go SDK #468, TS SDK #472, Python SDK #494. Receipts MUST NOT mix shapes within a single `parameters_disclosure` field; mode is per-emitter.
- `version` field now accepts `"0.1.0"`, `"0.2.0"`, `"0.2.1"`, or `"0.3.0"`. Verifiers MUST accept all four.

### Added
- `credentialSubject.action.peer_credential` — OS-attested peer process metadata captured by the daemon at the SDK↔daemon boundary (`platform`, `pid`, optional `uid`/`gid`/`exe_path`). Present only on receipts emitted through a daemon; daemon-attested, not agent-claimed. Replaces the `peer.*` keys that previously rode on `parameters_disclosure` in the daemon's legacy flat-map writes (ADR-0010).
- `credentialSubject.action.emitter_metadata` — Daemon-observed emitter-side metadata, currently a single `drop_count` field on synthetic events_dropped receipts. Replaces the `emitter.drop_count` key that previously rode on `parameters_disclosure`.

### Migration

**Issuers:** Daemon-mode emitters MUST move `peer.*` writes to `peer_credential` and `emitter.drop_count` writes to `emitter_metadata` when emitting 0.3.0 receipts. Direct-SDK emitters that use the envelope shape MUST set `version` to `"0.3.0"`.

**Verifiers:** No action required for 0.2.0 / 0.2.1 receipts (they validate unchanged against this schema). 0.3.0 receipts MAY carry either the legacy flat-map (continuing the 0.2.1 behaviour) or the envelope shape; verifiers handling both MUST dispatch on the JSON shape of `parameters_disclosure`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Field rename (schema-and-spec only):** `validFrom` → `issuanceDate`. All three SDKs have always emitted `issuanceDate` (VC 1.x naming); the schema is now aligned. No wire-format change for any existing receipt. See ADR-0009.
- **Optional-nullable types tightened:** `outcome.error`, `authorization.grant_ref`, and `action.trusted_timestamp` no longer declare `null` in their schema type. These fields MUST be absent (not `null`) when not applicable. The sole remaining nullable type in the schema is `chain.previous_receipt_hash` (required-nullable).
- `version` field now accepts `"0.1.0"`, `"0.2.0"`, or `"0.2.1"`. Verifiers MUST accept all three.

### Added
- Spec §7.1.1: normative null/optional field handling rule — required-nullable fields MUST be emitted with their value (including explicit `null`); optional fields MUST NOT be emitted when null or absent. Closes #85 at the spec level.
- `cross-sdk-tests/canonicalization_vectors.json`: shared canonicalisation test vectors covering UTF-16 key-sort edge cases, ES6 number boundaries, RFC 8259 string escaping, null normalisation, and signature preservation.
- ADR-0009: records the two spec-level decisions (VC field name commitment, null rule) and the signature-preservation invariant for existing receipts.

### Upgrade notes

**Issuers and verifiers:** No action required for existing receipts. All shipped 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 receipts already use `issuanceDate` and none emit `null` on optional fields, so the wire format is unchanged. Upgrade to `"version": "0.2.1"` when emitting new receipts to signal conformance to the null-rule and the tightened schema.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- `outcome.response_hash` — optional `sha256:`-prefixed hash of the RFC 8785 canonical JSON of the server's response, computed after secret redaction (redact → hash → sign). Issuers populate when emitting responses they wish to commit to; verifiers recompute when the response body is available and fail on mismatch. When the response body is absent the verifier notes "response hash present, body not supplied" and continues. Absence of the field is not a failure.
- `chain.terminal` — optional field restricted to the constant `true`. Marks the last receipt in a chain as closed. Explicit `false` is schema-invalid; absence means no claim. An automatic "receipt after terminal" integrity check invalidates any receipt that appears after a terminal receipt in the verified input sequence, regardless of linkage or caller parameters.
- `VerifyChain` gains three optional parameters across all SDKs — `ExpectedLength`, `ExpectedFinalHash`, `RequireTerminal` — for out-of-band and in-band truncation detection. When unsupplied, behaviour is identical to v0.1.0.
- Spec §7.3.1: normative language stating that chain verification does **not** detect tail truncation by default, documenting the three available mitigations, and stating the detection floor.
- Spec §7.3.2: normative language defining the unconditional receipt-after-terminal integrity check.

### Changed
- `version` field now accepts both `"0.1.0"` and `"0.2.0"`. Verifiers MUST accept both values. All new receipts SHOULD use `"0.2.0"`.

### Upgrade notes

**Issuers:** No action required to remain protocol-valid. To commit to the server's response, redact the response body, canonicalize (RFC 8785), hash (SHA-256), and populate `outcome.response_hash` before signing. To mark a chain as closed, set `chain.terminal: true` on the final receipt — omit the field entirely otherwise (never emit `false`).

**Verifiers:** No breaking changes. `VerifyChain` with no new parameters is identical to v0.1.0 behaviour. Pass `RequireTerminal: true` for chains that must close cleanly. Pass `ExpectedFinalHash` when you maintain an external audit record of chain state.
